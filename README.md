# Pedestrian-detection-for-smart-surveillance-cameras
In the field of security, the detection of persons remains a field of research despite the changes it has seen since its inception. A surveillance camera makes it possible to recover all types of objects. The objects that interest us in this project are human beings. The camera should only detect people who pass in its field of view.
